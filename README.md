BenchmarkSQL
============

BenchmarkSQL runs a TPC-C like test against relational databases to compare
performance across versions, settings, and vendors.
PostgreSQL, Db2 and other databases are supported.

BenchmarkSQL is open source, distributed under the GNU General Public License
version 2.0 (GPLv2) license.

You can check the documentation by:

* Reading the HOW-TO-RUN files under the docs directory.
* Access the Wiki - https://github.com/ECI-SGBD/BenchmarkSQL-4/wiki.

This is a fork of the BenchmarkSQL 4.
There are other most recent versions, BenchmarkSQL 5 and BenchmarkSQL;
however, these version are not as generic as this one, where many Java classes
should be modified in order to make it work.

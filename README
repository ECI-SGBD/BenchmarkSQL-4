Change Log:

Version 2.3.4  2013-01-29 denisl
   - Default build is now with JDK 1.6 and JDBC 4 PostgreSQL 9.2 driver
   - Remove outdated JDBC 3 drivers (for JDK 1.5).  You can run as before by
     a JDBC4 driver from any supported vendor.
   - Remove ExecJDBC warning about trying to rollback when in autocommit mode
   - Remove the extraneous COMMIT statemnts from the DDL scripts since ExecJDBC 
     runs in autocommit mode
   - Fix the version number displayed in the console

Version 2.3.3  2010-11-19 sjm  
   - Added DB2 LUW V9.7 support, and supercedes patch 2983892
   - No other changes from 2.3.2

Instructions for building
-------------------------

Use of JDK 1.6 is recommended, build with "ant jar" from the command line of 
the base directory or use your favorite IDE such as Netbeans or Eclipse.  


Instructions for running
------------------------
The below scripts all use relative paths, but, they depend on JAVA_HOME
environment variable being set so that the correct runtime can be found.

JDBC drivers and sample "?.properties" files are included to make it extremely easy for
you to test out the performance of PostgreSQL (or EnterpriseDB), MySQL, Oracle, DB2, & SQL Svr
in your environment.

Any special instructions by DBMS are prefaced  by <dbms_name>, else just substitute the appropriate properties 
file in the command lines below

1. Go to the 'run' directory, edit the appropriate "??????.properties" file to 
   point to the database instance you'd like to test.   

2. Run the "sqlTableCreates" to create the base tables.

        $ ./runSQL.sh postgres.properties sqlTableCreates


3. Run the "loadData" command file to load all of the default data for a benchmark:


  A.) Approximately half a million rows in total will be loaded across 9 tables
      per Warehouse.  (The default is numWarehouses=1)  A decent test size of data
      totaling about 1 GB is 10 warehouses as follows:
        $ ./loadData.sh postgres.properties numWarehouses 10
      Note: "loadData" will truncate all tables prior to inserting data through the JDBC program
      
      There is also a "sqlTableDrops" script  if you need it. If needed, run
         $ ./runSQL.sh postgres.properties sqlTableDrops

  B.) Alternatively, for PostgreSQL & DB2, you may choose to generate the load data out to CSV files:
        $ ./loadData.sh postgres.properties numWarehouses 10 fileLocation ./csv/   
        
      These CSV files can be bulk loaded as follows:
        $  ./runSQL.sh postgres.properties sqlTableCopies
      <DB2 LUW> ./runSQL db2.properties sqlTableCopies_DB2    //first check comments at top of sqlTableCopies_DB2

      You may clean out the data in the tables without dropping them via:
        $  ./runSQL.h postgres.properties sqlTableTruncates
      <DB2 LUW> ./runSQL.sh db2.properties sqlTableTruncates_DB2 //first check comments on top of sqlTableTruncates_DB2 

4. Run the "runSQL" command file to execute the SQL script "sqlIndexCreates" to 
   create the primary keys & other indexes on the tables.

        $  ./runSQL.sh postgres.properties sqlIndexCreates
      <DB2 LUW> ./runSQL.sh db2.properties sqlIndexCreates_DB2   //first check comments at top of sqlIndexCreates_DB2 


5. Run the "runBenchmark" command file to execute the swing GUI application to 
   test the database.  Don't forget to set the number of warehouses equal to the
   number you created in step 3. For each run, a report will be placed in run/reports.
   A sample report is included.

       $  ./runBenchmark.sh postgres.properties

6. Operational Notes to minimize problems:  
   (a) executing runBenchmark will start the GUI. 
       Click the Database button to view properties file settings. No changes are needed if the properties settings are correct.
       Click the Terminals button and specify desired settings. 
             Specify the same number of warehouses as you created.
             Select either "Minutes" or "Transactions per terminal" and blank out the other setting.
       Click the Weights button and specify desired settings
       Click the Controls button, then click Create Terminals. One DB connection per Terminal is created. Click Start Transactions to start the benchmark.
   (b) If changing the number of terminals between runs, it is best to close the GUI window and re-execute runBenchmark 
   (c) If the benchmark runs properly, all database connections are terminated at completion. You may need to manually
       terminate connections if this is not the case
   (d) When done, close the GUI window


Instructions for building
-------------------------

Use of JDK 1.5 is recommended, build with ANT 1.6+ from the command 
line or use the SUN Netbeans 4.1 Platform


Instructions for running
------------------------
The below scripts all use relative paths, but, they depend on JAVA_HOME
environment varibale being set so that the correct runtime can be found.

You are definetly best to use JDK 1.5, but, JDK 1.4 will also work.

1. Run the 'run/scripts' directory, edit the ?????.properties file to point to 
   your database instance


2. Run the 'sqlTableCreates' to create the base tables.

      $ ./runSQL.bat ????.properties sqlTableCreates


3. Run the command file to load all of the default data for a single warehouse instance of a tpc-c test:

     $ ./loadData.bat ?????.properties

    NOTE:  This will load a total of about half a million rows across the 9 tables


4. run the 'sqlIndexCreates' to create the primary keys & other indexes on the tables.

      $ ./runSQL.bat ?????.properties sqlIndexCreates


5. run the swing GUI application to test the database

     $  ./runBenchmark.bat ??????.properties
